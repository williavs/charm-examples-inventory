  ## Let’s talk about artichokes

  The artichoke is mentioned as a garden plant in the 8th century BC by Homer and Hesiod. The naturally
  occurring variant of the artichoke, the cardoon, which is native to the Mediterranean area, also has
  records of use as a food among the ancient Greeks and Romans. Pliny the Elder mentioned growing of carduus
  in Carthage and Cordoba.

  │ He holds him with a skinny hand,
  │ ‘There was a ship,’ quoth he.
  │ ‘Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!’
  │ An artichoke, dropt he.

  --Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner https://poetryfoundation.org/poems/43997/

  Ulysses

  by James Joyce

  Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a
  razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning
  air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:

  air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:

  —Introibo ad altare Dei.

  Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:

  "Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!"

  Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the
  tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
  towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. Stephen
  Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the
  shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained
  and hued like pale oak.
